Meeting Goals
Understand client’s problem and how it is solved now
“What is the basic problem you have with the way things are right now?”
“What will this project accomplish / enable you to do now that you couldn’t before?”

Understand the scope of the project
For example, whether a project has one major set of features around a particular problem, or multiple independent problems
“What are the 3 biggest features this app will have once it’s completed?”

Talk through a couple of scenarios
“What should I be able to do as a visitor?”, “What should I be able to do as an admin?”, etc.
Get some very lo fi mockups on pencil/paper
You will turn these into user stories afterward

Set expectations to meet for the next meeting
Underpromise but overdeliver, that is, understate how much work you expect to get done before the next meeting, then impress the NPO by delivering more
Make sure your goals are SMART!
Deliverables (due date: week 6’s section)
Github public repo, all team members given push access
Short (~2 min) entry interview with customer on Youtube. Do after you’ve talked through problem. Put video link in project README
Entry interview consists of recording NPO’s basic problem and what they are looking for, should be relatively informal
Make sure NPO is okay with making video public, else make sure it’s shared with cs169-staff@googlegroups.com
Sketches/Lo fi mockups and simple description of first couple of stories
User stories should be on Pivotal Tracker and you should have some Cucumber specs for them

Put these on a page on the Github wiki called “Iteration 0 Deliverables”
URL should look like https://github.com/<username>/<projectname>/wiki/Iteration-0-Deliverables
